Create alaramselect metrics and provide the detailscondition
notification section--&gt;EC2action select Reboot this instance.

put all ec2 instances across all availability zones in a regions,if one region get corrupt then move
another availability zone.

   git pull: download the all our changes and it will directly applied in our locally.
   git clone: to copy our remote repository into our local system by using clone.


12.what is merg & when u will  get merge conflict then how to overcome that conflicts.
A.to merge the branches. user1 and user2 edit the same file with the same line and trying the merge it then u will get merge conflict.
